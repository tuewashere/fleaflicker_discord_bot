# fleaflicker_discord_bot [WIP]
The goal of this project is to enhance the league's experience outside of the FleaFlicker platform. The Discord bot has two functions at the moment.
1. Everyday at 11am, a 24 hour summary of the league's transactions are sent to a specific Discord channel. Not everyone consistently checks the FleaFlicker app or website so having this function helps keep people informed about league transactions.
2. When someone types "!teams" the bot replies with every team name and who their owner is. People are constantly being creative and changing their team names. This can cause some confusion.

I create a Python script for each function before adding it to my Discord bot. Right now I am working on a power ranking function based off of this formula http://www.okiraqi.org/opr.html
