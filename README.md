# fleaflicker_discord_bot
I run a fairly a complex fantasy football league. To help with some aspects of running this league I am creating a discord bot and some scripts to help. I tried looking for a Discord bot that worked with the Fleaflicker API (https://www.fleaflicker.com/api-docs/index.html) but wasn't able to find one.
